                <p>Bruce Banner as a young man, thanks to his outstanding work in the field of nuclear physics, attracted the attention of the United States Army who wanted to adapt his theories for weaponry.
                While at the base, Banner began developing and building a bomb that used a high concentration of gamma radiation, a project of great interest to an undercover foreign agent stationed there. When a teenager named Rick Jones entered the testing range just as Banner began the countdown to the detonation of the gamma bomb test, the scientist rushed to the area to warn Jones, but the foreign agent continued the test. by the way. The bomb exploded, bathing Bruce Banner in its radiation.
                Incredibly, he survived the detonation, but later in the night he transformed into a large, gray, man-like monstrosity, nicknamed the "hulk" by one of the soldiers on the base.
